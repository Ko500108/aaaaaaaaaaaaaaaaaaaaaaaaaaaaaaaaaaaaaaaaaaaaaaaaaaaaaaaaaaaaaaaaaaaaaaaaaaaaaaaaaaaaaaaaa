# Minecraft-Unity3D

### See the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/O2Dzeo22/unity-minecraft-client)

I want to recreate the vanilla Minecraft client in Unity to a degree that the game is mostly playable. The idea is you can connect to a server and play with your friends like normal, and have a very close to vanilla experience. I might also add in some client-side modifications in the future ;)


Adding some screenshots to better explain where the project is at right now:
